# Face-Blurring
## (Problem #1) Face Blurring: You are expected to write an algorithm that blurs out people's faces in any given colored image without affecting the remaining parts of the image if any face exists.
### I used to solve the problem open-source library called OpenCV. also, I used  Haar Cascade frontal-face classifier is available as an XML file and is used for detecting faces in an image.
## Steps :
## 1. Import library 
## 2. Read the input image using OpenCV
## 3. Shows the image 
## 4. Detect the face
## 5. Draw a rectangle on the detected face
## 6. Blur the rectangle
## 7. show the output
